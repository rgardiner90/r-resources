# r-resources

This file was created for individuals who are interested in learning R, but do not know where to start (our own version of the "cold start" problem).  Over the past few years, I have privately collected a library of either free (or very cheap) resources for using R.  recently, I have decided to make this public using GitHub Pages.  This collection is focused primarily for using R in the TidyVerse.
